This are my solutions to the Matasano crypto challenges
(http://cryptopals.com) in Python 3.

A lot of solutions depend on pycryptodomex (https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodomex/).

For most challenges it suffices to run:

python3 challengeXX.py

but for some challenges, you might need to do:

python3 challengeXX_server.py

or similar first.
